# Geckos-Team-31

# Introduction
In this group project we will be making a clone of the website Trello (https://trello.com/). The team building this peoject is part of the Chingu Voyage 5 cohort (https://medium.com/chingu). We are 2 developers working remotely in different countries throughout Europe.  

# User Roles
Users will be able to create new lists and cards withing lists. Users can rename the lists and cards at their discretion, as well a delete cards or lists with ease. Users can drag and drop cards into new lists, as well as reorder lists by dragging them. Users can change the color theme, as well as rename the board. 

# Design
We will be using HTML5 and CSS3 in conjunction with the Bootstrap 4 framework for the design and layout of the site. We will use Javascript and the Jquery library for the functionality of the site. We also used Font Awesome Icons for the button icons used on the site: https://fontawesome.com/.

The site should look and feel like trello. The UI should be easy to use for anyone who has used trello before and even fairly straightforward for those who haven't.
